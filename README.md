## ðŸŽ¥ From the Pixelburen Private Server

All advancements are written in **Dutch**, since Pixelburen is a Dutch YouTube community made up of family and friends. This datapack gives our fans â€” and anyone else â€” the chance to enjoy the same features we play with on our private server. Itâ€™s designed for **multiplayer**, but works perfectly in singleplayer too. And best of all: itâ€™s 100% vanilla, with no mods required.
